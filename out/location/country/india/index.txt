The earliest mention of the Andhras occurs in Aitareya Brahmana (c. 800 BCE) of the Rigveda. Around 300 BCE, the Andhras living in the Godavari and Krishna river deltas were renowned for their formidable military strength—second only to the Maurya Empire in the subcontinent. The first major Andhra polity was the Satavahana dynasty (2nd century BCE–2nd century CE) which ruled over the entire Deccan Plateau and even distant areas of western and central India. They established trade relations with the Roman Empire. After that, the major rulers included the Vishnukundinas, Eastern Chalukyas, Kakatiyas, Vijayanagara Empire, Qutb Shahis, and the British Raj. After Indian independence, Andhra State was bifurcated from Madras state in 1953. It was merged with Telangana, comprising Telugu speaking areas of the former Hyderabad state, to form Andhra Pradesh in 1956. It reverted to its earlier form on 2 June 2014, when the new state of Telangana was formed through bifurcation.c:{"src":"/_next/static/media/countries-continents-text-map-wallpaper-preview.b17d4b9a.jpg","height":410,"width":728,"blurDataURL":"data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAQAAAQABAAD/2wCEAAoKCgoKCgsMDAsPEA4QDxYUExMUFiIYGhgaGCIzICUgICUgMy03LCksNy1RQDg4QFFeT0pPXnFlZXGPiI+7u/sBCgoKCgoKCwwMCw8QDhAPFhQTExQWIhgaGBoYIjMgJSAgJSAzLTcsKSw3LVFAODhAUV5PSk9ecWVlcY+Ij7u7+//CABEIAAUACAMBIgACEQEDEQH/xAAoAAEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABgEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQL/2gAMAwEAAhADEAAAAI0Uf//EAB4QAAECBwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIBEQADBBITFCJB/9oACAEBAAE/ABqV18SgPUu1S9YXaP/EABQRAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD/2gAIAQIBAT8Af//EABQRAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD/2gAIAQMBAT8Af//Z","blurWidth":8,"blurHeight":5}
