Assam covers an area of 78,438 km2 (30,285 sq mi). It is the second largest state in northeastern India by area and the largest in terms of population, with more than 31 million inhabitants. The state is bordered by Bhutan and Arunachal Pradesh to the north; Nagaland and Manipur to the east; Meghalaya, Tripura, Mizoram and Bangladesh to the south; and West Bengal to the west via the Siliguri Corridor, a 22-kilometre-wide (14 mi) strip of land that connects the state to the rest of India. Assamese and Bodo are two of the official languages for the entire state and Meitei (Manipuri) is recognised as an additional official language in three districts of Barak Valley and Hojai district.[15] in Hojai district and for the Barak valley region, alongside Bengali, which is also an official language in the Barak Valley."}],["$","p","1",{"className":"singleCountryMain_gap_bottom_20__nHofH","children":"The state has 35 districts with 5 divisions.

The state was the first site for oil drilling in Asia.[16] Assam is home to the one-horned Indian rhinoceros, along with the wild water buffalo, pygmy hog, tiger and various species of Asiatic birds, and provides one of the last wild habitats for the Asian elephant. The Assamese economy is aided by wildlife tourism to Kaziranga National Park and Manas National Park, which are World Heritage Sites. Dibru-Saikhowa National Park is famed for its feral horses. Sal tree forests are found in the state which, as a result of abundant rainfall, look green all year round. Assam receives more rainfall than most parts of India; this rain feeds the Brahmaputra River, whose tributaries and oxbow lakes provide the region with a distinctive hydro-geomorphic environment."}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"singleCountryMain_gap_top_20__yUEU7"}],["$","$L3",null,{"lat":26.14,"lng":91.77,"zoom":5}],["$","div",null,{"className":"singleCountryMain_gap_top_20__yUEU7"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"singleCountryMain_image_grid__lPKd5","children":[["$","div","0",{"className":"singleCountryMain_image_item__TzZ4f","children":["$","$L4",null,{"src":{"src":"/_next/static/media/countries-continents-text-map-wallpaper-preview.b17d4b9a.jpg","height":410,"width":728,"blurDataURL":"data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAQAAAQABAAD/2wCEAAoKCgoKCgsMDAsPEA4QDxYUExMUFiIYGhgaGCIzICUgICUgMy03LCksNy1RQDg4QFFeT0pPXnFlZXGPiI+7u/sBCgoKCgoKCwwMCw8QDhAPFhQTExQWIhgaGBoYIjMgJSAgJSAzLTcsKSw3LVFAODhAUV5PSk9ecWVlcY+Ij7u7+//CABEIAAUACAMBIgACEQEDEQH/xAAoAAEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABgEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQL/2gAMAwEAAhADEAAAAI0Uf//EAB4QAAECBwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIBEQADBBITFCJB/9oACAEBAAE/ABqV18SgPUu1S9YXaP/EABQRAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD/2gAIAQIBAT8Af//EABQRAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD/2gAIAQMBAT8Af//Z","blurWidth":8,"blurHeight":5},"alt":"","width":334,"height":200}]}],["$","div","1",{"className":"singleCountryMain_image_item__TzZ4f","children":["$","$L4",null,{"src":{"src":"/_next/static/media/map-typography-colorful-dark-wallpaper-preview.31ca5df1.jpg","height":410,"width":728,"blurDataURL":"data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAQAAAQABAAD/2wCEAAoKCgoKCgsMDAsPEA4QDxYUExMUFiIYGhgaGCIzICUgICUgMy03LCksNy1RQDg4QFFeT0pPXnFlZXGPiI+7u/sBCgoKCgoKCwwMCw8QDhAPFhQTExQWIhgaGBoYIjMgJSAgJSAzLTcsKSw3LVFAODhAUV5PSk9ecWVlcY+Ij7u7+//CABEIAAUACAMBIgACEQEDEQH/xAAoAAEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABwEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQP/2gAMAwEAAhADEAAAAJ2Cn//EABwQAAICAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEDAhEAIQUiQv/aAAgBAQABPwBvIl6yqaYEsVG50LHXzrWf/8QAFREBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQD/2gAIAQIBAT8AC//EABgRAAIDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAExAAJR/9oACAEDAQE/ALIDFP/Z","blurWidth":8,"blurHeight":5},"alt":"","width":334,"height":200}]}]]}],["$undefined","$undefined"],["$undefined","$undefined"]]}]],null],null]},["$","$L5",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","segmentPath":["children","location","children","country","children","india","children","assam","children"],"error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$L6",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":"$undefined","notFoundStyles":"$undefined","styles":[["$","link","0",{"rel":"stylesheet","href":"/_next/static/css/11c1c6ba1d6b6c36.css","precedence":"next","crossOrigin":"$undefined"}]]}],null]},["$","$L5",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","segmentPath":["children","location","children","country","children","india","children"],"error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$L6",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":"$undefined","notFoundStyles":"$undefined","styles":null}],null]},["$","$L5",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","segmentPath":["children","location","children","country","children"],"error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$L6",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":"$undefined","notFoundStyles":"$undefined","styles":null}],null]},["$","$L5",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","segmentPath":["children","location","children"],"error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$L6",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":"$undefined","notFoundStyles":"$undefined","styles":null}],null]},[["$","html",null,{"lang":"en","children":[["$","head",null,{"children":"$undefined"}],["$","body",null,{"className":"__className_d65c78","children":["$","$L5",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","segmentPath":["children"],"error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$L6",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":["$","div",null,{"className":"container","children":["$","$L2",null,{"error":true}]}],"notFoundStyles":[["$","link","0",{"rel":"stylesheet","href":"/_next/static/css/11c1c6ba1d6b6c36.css","precedence":"next","crossOrigin":"$undefined"}]],"styles":null}]}]]}],null],null],[[["$","link","0",{"rel":"stylesheet","href":"/_next/static/css/1fadfc1043bd9509.css","precedence":"next","crossOrigin":"$undefined"}]],"$L7"]]]]
