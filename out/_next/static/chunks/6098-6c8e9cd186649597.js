The state shares borders with Telangana to the northwest, Odisha to the northeast, Chhattisgarh to the north, Karnataka to the southwest, Tamil Nadu to the south, and the Bay of Bengal to the southeast. It has the second-longest coastline in India at about 974 km (605 mi).","Archaeological evidence suggests that Andhra Pradesh has had continuous human presence for over 247,000 years, ranging from early archaic hominins to Neolithic settlements. The earliest mention of the Andhras occurs in Aitareya Brahmana (c. 800 BCE) of the Rigveda. Around 300 BCE, the Andhras living in the Godavari and Krishna river deltas were renowned for their formidable military strength—second only to the Maurya Empire in the subcontinent. The first major Andhra polity was the Satavahana dynasty (2nd century BCE–2nd century CE) which ruled over the entire Deccan Plateau and even distant areas of western and central India. They established trade relations with the Roman Empire. After that, the major rulers included the Vishnukundinas, Eastern Chalukyas, Kakatiyas, Vijayanagara Empire, Qutb Shahis, and the British Raj. After Indian independence, Andhra State was bifurcated from Madras state in 1953. It was merged with Telangana, comprising Telugu speaking areas of the former Hyderabad state, to form Andhra Pradesh in 1956. It reverted to its earlier form on 2 June 2014, when the new state of Telangana was formed through bifurcation.","The Eastern ghats separate coastal plains and peneplains. Krishna, Godavari, and Penna are the major rivers. The state has about one-third of India's limestone reserves, large deposits of baryte and granite. The population engaged in agriculture and related activities is 62.17%. Rice is the state's major food crop and staple food. The state contributes to 30% of fish production in India and had a share of 35% in total sea food exports of India. Sriharikota Range at the barrier island of Sriharikota in Tirupati district, is the primary satellite launching station of India.","Amaravati School of Art, a major ancient Indian art style that influenced South Indian, Sri Lankan, and Southeast Asian art arose from this state. Kuchipudi, one of India's classical dances originated in the state. Several renowned Carnatic music composers trace their origins to the state. The state is home to a variety of pilgrimage centres and natural attractions such as Tirumala Venkateswara temple near Tirupati, Mallikarjuna temple at Srisailam, and Araku valley.

It is the seventh-largest country by area; the most populous country as of June 2023; and from the time of its independence in 1947, the world's most populous democracy. Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast, it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the north; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand, Myanmar, and Indonesia.        ","Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago. Their long occupation, initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers, has made the region highly diverse, second only to Africa in human genetic diversity. Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago, evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE. By 1200 BCE, an archaic form of Sanskrit, an Indo-European language, had diffused into India from the northwest. Its evidence today is found in the hymns of the Rigveda. Preserved by an oral tradition that was resolutely vigilant, the Rigveda records the dawning of Hinduism in India. The Dravidian languages of India were supplanted in the northern and western regions. By 400 BCE, stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within Hinduism, and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen, proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity. Early political consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires based in the Ganges Basin. Their collective era was suffused with wide-ranging creativity, but also marked by the declining status of women, and the incorporation of untouchability into an organised system of belief. In South India, the Middle kingdoms exported Dravidian-languages scripts and religious cultures to the kingdoms of Southeast Asia.","In the early medieval era, Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Zoroastrianism became established on India's southern and western coasts. Muslim armies from Central Asia intermittently overran India's northern plains, eventually founding the Delhi Sultanate, and drawing northern India into the cosmopolitan networks of medieval Islam. In the 15th century, the Vijayanagara Empire created a long-lasting composite Hindu culture in south India. In the Punjab, Sikhism emerged, rejecting institutionalised religion. The Mughal Empire, in 1526, ushered in two centuries of relative peace, leaving a legacy of luminous architecture.[l] Gradually expanding rule of the British East India Company followed, turning India into a colonial economy, but also consolidating its sovereignty. British Crown rule began in 1858. The rights promised to Indians were granted slowly, but technological changes were introduced, and modern ideas of education and the public life took root. A pioneering and influential nationalist movement emerged, which was noted for nonviolent resistance and became the major factor in ending British rule. In 1947 the British Indian Empire was partitioned into two independent dominions, a Hindu-majority Dominion of India and a Muslim-majority Dominion of Pakistan, amid large-scale loss of life and an unprecedented migration.","India has been a federal republic since 1950, governed through a democratic parliamentary system. It is a pluralistic, multilingual and multi-ethnic society. India's population grew from 361 million in 1951 to almost 1.4 billion in 2022. During the same time, its nominal per capita income increased from US$64 annually to US$2,601, and its literacy rate from 16.6% to 74%. From being a comparatively destitute country in 1951, India has become a fast-growing major economy and a hub for information technology services, with an expanding middle class. India has a space programme with several planned or completed extraterrestrial missions. Indian movies, music, and spiritual teachings play an increasing role in global culture. India has substantially reduced its rate of poverty, though at the cost of increasing economic inequality. India is a nuclear-weapon state, which ranks high in military expenditure. It has disputes over Kashmir with its neighbours, Pakistan and China, unresolved since the mid-20th century. Among the socio-economic challenges India faces are gender inequality, child malnutrition, and rising levels of air pollution. India's land is megadiverse, with four biodiversity hotspots. Its forest cover comprises 21.7% of its area. India's wildlife, which has traditionally been viewed with tolerance in India's culture, is supported among these forests, and elsewhere, in protected habitats."],states:[...c],unionterritories:[...m],capital:"",polygon:[]},w={name:"United States",code:"united_states",img:[...h],lat:40.713,lng:-99.833,zoom:3,para:["The United States of America (USA or U.S.A.), commonly known as the United States (US or U.S.) or America, is a country primarily located in North America.

Outside the union of states, it asserts sovereignty over five major unincorporated island territories and various uninhabited islands.

British colonization led to the first settlement of the\n        Thirteen Colonies in Virginia in 1607. Clashes with the British Crown\n        over taxation and political representation sparked the American\n        Revolution, with the Second Continental Congress formally declaring\n        independence on July 4, 1776. Following its victory in the\n        Revolutionary War (1775–1783), the country continued to expand across\n        North America. As more states were admitted, sectional division over\n        slavery led to the secession of the Confederate States of America,\n        which fought the remaining states of the Union during the 1861–1865\n        American Civil War. With the Union's victory and preservation, slavery\n        was abolished nationally. By 1890, the United States had established\n        itself as a great power. After Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor in\n        December 1941, the U.S. entered World War II. The aftermath of the war\n        left the U.S. and the Soviet Union as the world's two superpowers and\n        led to the Cold War, during which both countries engaged in a struggle\n        for ideological dominance and international influence. Following the\n        Soviet Union's collapse and the end of the Cold War in 1991, the U.S.\n        emerged as the world's sole superpower.","The U.S. national government is a presidential constitutional republic\n        and liberal democracy with three separate branches: legislative,\n        executive, and judicial.

Substantial autonomy is given to states\n        and several territories, with a political culture that emphasizes\n        liberty, equality under the law, individualism, and limited\n        government.","One of the world's most developed countries, the United States has had\n        the largest nominal GDP since about 1890 and accounted for 15% of the\n        global economy in 2023.
